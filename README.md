### **üí° Technology Choices & Architecture**

This project was built with a modern, scalable tech stack, prioritizing developer experience and type safety.

* **Frontend:** **Vite + React** was chosen for its blazing-fast development server and optimized build process. **Tailwind CSS** provides a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid UI development.
* **Backend:** **Express.js** offers a minimalist and flexible foundation for the API. **Prisma** was selected as the ORM to bridge the application with the PostgreSQL database, providing incredible autocompletion and ensuring all database queries are type-safe, which drastically reduces runtime errors.
* **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Neon** was used for its reliability and robust feature set suitable for relational data.
* **Deployment:** The entire application (both frontend and backend services) is deployed on **Vercel** for its seamless Git integration, automatic deployments, and serverless function support.
