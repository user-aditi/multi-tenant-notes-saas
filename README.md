## üè¢ Multi-Tenancy Approach

This project implements a **Shared Schema, Shared Database** approach using a `tenant_slug` column as the discriminator.

* All data for all tenants resides in the same set of tables (`users`, `notes`, etc.).
* Each table that contains tenant-specific data has a `tenant_slug` column.
* Every database query is strictly filtered by the `tenant_slug` of the authenticated user, which is extracted from their JWT.

This approach was chosen for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of management for an application of this scale. It avoids the complexity of managing multiple schemas or databases while still providing robust data isolation at the application layer.

## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v20.x or later)
* `npm` or `yarn`
* A PostgreSQL database (e.g., a free tier from [Neon](https://neon.tech/))

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create a .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env
````

**4. Configure your `.env` file:**
Update the `backend/.env` file with your database credentials and a secure JWT secret.

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Your PostgreSQL Connection String Details
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your-database-name
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
```

**5. Set up the Database:**
Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a client like `psql` or TablePlus and run the SQL script located at `backend/src/models/database.sql`. This will create all the necessary tables and seed the initial test accounts.

**6. Run the Backend Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2\. Frontend Setup

```bash
# 1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create a .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

**4. Configure your `.env` file:**
Ensure the `frontend/.env` file points to your local backend server.

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**5. Run the Frontend Development Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
